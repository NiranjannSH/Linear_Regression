Linear regression is a fundamental statistical and machine learning technique used for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable (usually denoted as 'y') and one or more independent variables (denoted as 'x'). In simple linear regression, there is only one independent variable.

## Purpose of Linear Regression

- **Prediction**: Linear regression helps us predict a target variable (y) based on the values of one or more independent variables (x).
- **Relationship Analysis**: It helps us understand the nature and strength of the relationship between variables.
- **Model Interpretation**: Linear regression provides coefficients that can be interpreted to understand the impact of each independent variable on the target variable.

## The Equation: y = mx + c

The equation for simple linear regression is often expressed as:

- **y**: The dependent variable we want to predict.
- **x**: The independent variable, also known as the predictor.
- **m**: The slope of the line, which represents the change in y for a unit change in x.
- **c**: The y-intercept, which is the value of y when x is 0.

In simple terms, linear regression fits a straight line to the data points, minimizing the sum of squared differences (residuals) between the observed data points and the values predicted by the line. The slope (m) and y-intercept (c) of this line are determined during the training process.

By adjusting the values of 'm' and 'c,' we can create a line that best describes the relationship between 'x' and 'y.' This line can be used for making predictions, understanding correlations, and deriving insights from the data.

Linear regression is a powerful tool for modeling relationships between variables and is widely used in various fields, including economics, finance, biology, and machine learning.
